#  Code of Conduct

## 1. Values

- **Inclusivity and Respect**: Treat all contributors and users with dignity and fairness, regardless of background, experience, or identity.
- **Empowerment & Collaboration**: Encourage skills development, sharing of ideas, and co-production of data products, embracing open science where appropriate and community-driven improvement.
- **Supportiveness**: Strive to make the project a helpful, welcoming space, where questions and discussions are met with patience, curiosity, and encouragement—not derision or exclusion.

- Discriminatory jokes or language related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or age.
- Plagiarism, falsification, or misrepresentation of contributions or data.

## 6. Commitment to Improvement
